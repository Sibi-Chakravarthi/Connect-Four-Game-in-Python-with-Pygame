# Connect-Four-Game-in-Python-with-Pygame
I made a Connect Four in Python with Pygame just as a side project to test my knowledge on what i was taught in school on python and just learn a lot about modules and how they work .This file is so much not optimized because its my first project
And guys btw to run this you will need pygame module installed i will upload .exe file later
